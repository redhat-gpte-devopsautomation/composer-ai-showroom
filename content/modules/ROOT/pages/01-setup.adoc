This cluster is equipped with a single g5.2xlarge node containing an A10g GPU, but it will autoscale additional GPU nodes as we spin up additional resources.

NOTE: The repo used to manage the cluster resources can be found https://github.com/redhat-composer-ai/cluster-gitops[here].  This repo is based on the https://github.com/redhat-ai-services/ai-accelerator[AI Accelerator] an asset created and maintained by the NA AI Practice for use with deploying and managing OpenShift AI in customer environments.
