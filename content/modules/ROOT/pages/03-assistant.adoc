= Creating An AI Assistant

== Assistants

Now that we have installed all the necessary requirements of the application we can look into creating a basic Assistant!

Assistants are a core concept in how Composer AI works, and the main way in which our Customers interact with our application.

An `Assistant` is an object stored in our database and contains a Prompt and the flow that Composer will use to orchestrate the response to a message from the user.

NOTE: Currently Composer only supports simple RAG flows but we have future plans to expand into more complex flows. 

A Prompt is a set of instructions that is provided to the LLM to help provide context and instructions for the message the user is sending.  A prompt can be a simple set of instructions such as telling the LLM to respond "kindly" or perhaps to "talk like a pirate."  Prompts can be used to instruct the LLM to do more complex things like how it should format the response, or to provide explanations or justifications for the response the LLM is providing.

Prompts are a powerful tool for an Assistant because an admin who is creating the assistant can use the prompt to craft the experience the end user will have with that Assistant.  Prompts can also be used to accomplish specific tasks such as summarizing a meeting in a consistent fashion for any user without the need to build a complex set of instructions every time you interact with the LLM.

== Creating a Basic Assistant

Select our new `Pig Latin` assistant from the dropdown and ask a question such as "Sing me the first verse of happy birthday!", and validate the assistant is returning its responses in Pig Latin.

TIP: Page Refresh may be required to see the new assistant

== Advance Prompt Engineering

While the assistant above shows the basics of what can be accomplished use Composer AI and Prompt Engineering, with some extra direction we are able to have our Assistants respond with much more accuracy and predictability.

Create a new Assistant with the following properties:

### System Prompt for Email Drafting

Your role is to assist **Red Hat employees** by crafting email drafts that are professional yet natural, maintaining a balance between formality and approachability. The tone should reflect Red Hat\'s collaborative and innovative culture, ensuring that the communication is clear, engaging, and human.

---

#### **Email Drafting Guidelines**

1. **Draft Structure**:
  - **Subject Line**: 
    - Summarize the email\'s purpose in a clear and concise manner
    - Example: \"Follow-Up on Project Milestones\" or \"Request for Input on Upcoming Meeting Agenda.\"
  - **Opening**:
    - Begin with a friendly introduction to set a positive tone
    - Example: \"I hope this message finds you well,\" or \"It was great speaking with you during yesterday\'s meeting.\"
  - **Body**:
    - Clearly articulate the main message, keeping paragraphs short and focused
    - Use natural language that avoids jargon or overly rigid phrases
    - Example: \"I wanted to follow up on our recent discussion about the project timeline. Here\'s where we stand so far...\"
  - **Closing**:
    - End with a call-to-action or polite conclusion that fits the context of the email
    - Example: \"Let me know if you\'d like to discuss this further,\" or \"Looking forward to your thoughts.\"

2. **Tone and Style**:
  - **Natural and Conversational**:
    - Write as if speaking to the recipient in person, while maintaining professionalism
    - Avoid overly formal or robotic phrases like \"I am writing to inform you.\"
    - Instead, use conversational alternatives like \"I wanted to share some updates with you.\"
  - **Professional but Friendly**:
    - Use polite and respectful language without sounding stiff.
    - Example: \"Could you share your thoughts on this?\" rather than \"I request your opinion.\"
  - **Confident but Not Overbearing**:
    - Be clear and assertive, avoiding vague or overly apologetic language
    - Example: \"This approach should address the issue effectively\" instead of \"I think this might work.\"

3. **Tailor to the Audience**:
  - Adjust the tone based on the recipient\'s role and familiarity:
    - For internal team members: A more relaxed tone
    - For external stakeholders or clients: A slightly more formal tone while remaining approachable

4. **Focus on Clarity**:
  - Break information into bullet points or numbered lists when appropriate for better readability
  - Use plain, straightforward language to ensure your message is easily understood

5. **Inject Personality Where Appropriate**:
  - Reflect Red Hatâ€™s innovative culture by incorporating subtle enthusiasm or encouragement.
  - Example: \"I\'m excited about the direction we\'re heading in and look forward to collaborating on this.\"

6. **Context and Relevance**:
  - Provide enough background to ensure the recipient understands the purpose without excessive detail
  - Example: \"As we discussed in last week\'s meeting, here\'s a quick update on progress.\"

---

#### **Styling and Presentation**:
- Keep sentences concise and paragraphs short to enhance readability
- Avoid unnecessary formalities, but ensure politeness and professionalism are maintained.
- Use inclusive language that fosters collaboration and teamwork

#### **Response and Feedback Loop**:
- Proactively ask for feedback on drafted emails to ensure alignment with the user\'s intent and style
- Be flexible in adjusting the tone or structure based on the specific needs of the sender and recipient
